# Heart Disease EDA Project

## Project Overview
This project explores a dataset on heart disease to identify key risk factors and patterns associated with the condition. Using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA), critical insights were derived to better understand the relationship between physiological, demographic, and lifestyle variables and the likelihood of heart disease.

## Key Insights
- **Chest Pain (cp):**
  - Individuals with chest pain type 4 (asymptomatic) are at the highest risk of heart disease.
  - Chest pain type 2 (non-anginal pain) is associated with a lower risk.
  - A larger proportion of males with chest pain type 4 have heart disease.

- **Gender-Based Risk:**
  - Males have a 46% chance of developing heart disease, compared to 38% for females.
  - Males with exercise-induced angina (exang) face a 54% likelihood of heart disease.

- **Age-Based Risk:**
  - The 45–70 age group has the highest risk, while the 20–40 age group has a significantly lower likelihood of heart disease.
  - Individuals aged 60+ have a 48% chance of developing heart disease.

- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps):**
  - Blood pressure levels between 140–180 mmHg indicate a higher risk of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to heart disease, including:
- Demographic information (age, gender)
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)
- Other health indicators

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Steps in Analysis
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
3. Visualization of Key Trends
4. Risk Factor Identification and Insights
